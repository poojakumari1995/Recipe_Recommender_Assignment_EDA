Recipe Recommender Assignment - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
Welcome to the Recipe Recommender Assignment repository! This project is centered around conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a recipe dataset to gain insights into the culinary preferences and patterns of users. Through data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis, we aim to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify potential features for building a recipe recommendation system.

Key Objectives
Data Exploration: Analyze the structure, content, and quality of the recipe dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics, distributions, and correlations between variables.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships and trends within the data.
Ingredient Analysis: Investigate the frequency and popularity of ingredients, common ingredient combinations, and ingredient co-occurrences.
User Preferences: Examine user ratings, reviews, and preferences to understand the factors influencing recipe selection.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarize findings and provide insights for building a recipe recommendation system.
Folder Structure
data: Contains the raw recipe dataset.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
reports: Documentation including the final report detailing the EDA process, findings, and insights.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas, NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computations.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Tools for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for data analysis and documentation.
Usage
To replicate the EDA:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory in sequential order.
